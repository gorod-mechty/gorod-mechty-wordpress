В Детском парке Симферополя группой добровольцев были высажены несколько десятков приобретенных Фондом декоративных кустарников. Подготовительные работы были проведены заранее: приобретен и доставлен в парк посадочный материал, засыпка, подготовлена почва, уложено агроволокно, которое препятствует росту сорняков. Собравшиеся по призыву Фонда волонтеры, под руководством озеленителя Ирины Калмыковой и под наблюдением директора коммунального учреждения «Детский парк» Александра Шабанова высадили саженцы кустарника, полили их, зачистили и благоустроили площадку. Теперь вход в зооуголок украшает клумба с кустами лаванды, осоки власовидной, юкки, чабреца, очитка, мискантуса зебрина и пр. Все растения акклиматизированы в условиях Крыма, устойчивы к засухе и не требуют сложного ухода.'
